Predicting ADHD Outcomes in Children Using Machine Learning Techniques
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelop- mental disorder affecting children worldwide, characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. This study aims to predict ADHD out- comes based on various socio-demographic, behavioral, and health-related factors using machine learning models. Utilizing the 2017 National Survey of Childrenâ€™s Health (NSCH) dataset, we employed Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gra- dient Boosting classifiers to identify significant predictors of ADHD. The dataset was meticulously preprocessed to handle missing values and exclude invalid ADHD codes, ensuring data integrity and reliability. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into the distribution and relationships of variables, informing fea- ture selection and model training. Our models achieved high accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores, with the Gradient Boosting model demonstrating the highest performance. Feature importance analysis revealed that ADHD sever- ity, special health care needs, and other mental health conditions are critical factors in predicting ADHD outcomes. These findings can inform targeted interventions and support mechanisms for children at risk of ADHD, contributing to improved diagnostic and treatment strategies.
